# Testing and verification

**Latest recorded run:** 13 September 2026, Windows, Node 24.11.1, npm 11.6.2.

## 1. Commands

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
```

Vitest runs tests/core.test.ts. Build first checks all app and test TypeScript under strict mode, then creates dist/. The current suite has **18 tests** and passed. The production build passed.

## 2. Automated coverage

| Area | Existing evidence |
|---|---|
| Reproducibility | Same founders, parent inputs and seed produce same offspring, mutation log, phenotype and checksum |
| Parental origin | 500 crosses with mutation disabled; each maternal/paternal allele comes from the corresponding parent |
| Mendelian segregation | 10,000 seeded offspring; recessive locus frequencies within 2 percentage points of 25/50/25 |
| Linkage | 10,000 synthetic marker crosses; adjacent boundary switch frequency within 2 points of 0.12 |
| Mutation | Forced mutations produce 96 matching log entries, valid alleles and no boundary no-op |
| Expression | All-zero, all-five, heterozygous extremes and 1,000 founders have finite positive anatomy/speed |
| Tradeoff | Changing tail length alone decreases speed as specified |
| Selection | Ten selected generations increase mean body depth by more than 0.08 compared with starting pool |
| Pedigree | Unrelated, self, full siblings, half siblings, parent-offspring, cousins, sold ancestors and input reordering |
| Birth command | Twenty unique IDs, correct parent links/generation, original world unchanged, save round-trip |
| Capacity | Cohort overflow rejected with no partial births or ID changes |
| Parent eligibility | Same-parent misuse rejected; accelerated second generation supported |
| Sale | Funds paid once, genome/pedigree retained, repeat sale and breeding archived parent rejected |
| Transfer/rename | Identity/genome preserved; invalid name/destination rejected |
| NPC purchase | Funds deducted, new founder, immediate resale loses credits, insufficient funds rejected |
| Save validation | Bad JSON, version, duplicates, IDs, tanks, cycles and allele bounds rejected |
| Motion | Two 2,000-tick runs agree, positions remain finite and in bounds |

These statistical checks use fixed seeds and wide tolerances to catch implementation regressions. They do not establish biological validity or rigorous randomness certification.

## 3. Browser verification performed

The agent-browser CLI was not installed, so the connected Codex browser was used instead.

- Opened local app and inspected the actual Canvas aquarium and portrait.
- Confirmed no blank page or runtime error overlay.
- Read captured console warnings/errors: none observed.
- Bred founders Haru and Sumi: residents increased from 6 to 26; selected offspring had parent links and G1.
- Renamed FSH-000007 to Ember; transferred to Breeding Studio.
- Opened Family and selected Haru: inspector focused Haru and aquarium changed to The Koi Garden.
- Sold Haru to local NPC through the review step; archived profile retained genotype and facts.
- Reloaded: tank counts remained 24 in garden and 1 in studio; Ember’s renamed record was still in the studio.
- Checked responsive viewport at 390 × 844; document width did not exceed viewport; aquarium and core controls remained visible. Horizontal tank-selector scrolling is intentional.

This is a representative smoke check. Export download, every genome cell, every browser engine, screen-reader behavior, and complete text-zoom accessibility have not been exhaustively verified.

## 4. Required next verification

### Visual inheritance / FS-101–107

Fixed-seed phenotype tables, portraits/contact sheets, six extreme anatomies, parent-child resemblance study, multi-trait selection and readability under larger text. Do not assert a perceptual metric based only on allele counts.

### Runtime / M2

Worker start/stop/restart, strict-mode mount cleanup, command idempotency, timestamp boundaries, active/background integration comparison, negative/offline clocks, bounded catch-up, failed save transactions, quota and multi-tab writers.

### Aquarium / M3–4

Care recovery, nutrition/waste integration, life stage thresholds, fry reveal, capacity reservations, same-tick hatch cancellation, interrupted courtship, listed/sold/dead parent eligibility, history retention and larger pedigree graphs.

### Solo release / M7

Named hardware/browser benchmark, long-run memory, 100-generation genetics/anatomy soak, 2,000 owned-fish background test, restore/migration matrix, keyboard-only journeys, contrast, touch, reduced motion and Firefox/Chromium/WebKit behavior.

### Online / M8

Two simultaneous buyers, duplicate command retries, rollback on debit/transfer failure, stale listing versions, funds/capacity limits, authorization, private lineage redaction, sandbox import isolation, clock manipulation and transaction audit.

## 5. Evidence format

For a test report record task ID, source/model version, command or user journey, fixture/seed, environment, expected outcome, actual outcome, limitations, and relevant artifacts. Tests should verify domain promises or meaningful failure conditions, not mirror implementation line for line.
